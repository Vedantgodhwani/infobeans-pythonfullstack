#2. Factorial of a Number
#In project scheduling, tasks are dependent on previous tasks, and the total number of ways to arrange them is calculated using factorial. Factorial of a number n is the product of all #numbers from 1 to n.
#Write a program to calculate the **factorial of a given number using loops**.

#Input: n = 5
#Output: Total Ways = 120




n=int(input("enter the number "))
fact=1
for i in range (n,0,-1):
	fact*=i
print("total ways=",fact)
